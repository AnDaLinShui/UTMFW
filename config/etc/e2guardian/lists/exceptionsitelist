#Sites in exception list
#Don't bother with the www. or
#the http://
#
#These are specifically domains and are not URLs.
#For example 'foo.bar/porn/' is no good, you need
#to just have 'foo.bar'.
#
#You can also match IPs here too.
#
#As of DansGuardian 2.7.3 you can now include
#.tld so for example you can match .gov for example


# Time limiting syntax:
# #time: <start hour> <start minute> <end hour> <end minute> <days>
# Example:
##time: 9 0 17 0 01234
# Remove the first # from the line above to enable this list only from
# 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.


# Blanket exception.  To allow all sites except those in the
# exceptionsitelist and greysitelist files, remove
# the # from the next line to leave only a '**':
#**

# Blanket SSL/CONNECT exception.  To allow all SSL 
# and CONNECT tunnels except to addresses in the
# exceptionsitelist and greysitelist files, remove
# the # from the next line to leave only a '**s':
#**s

# Blanket IP exception.  To allow all sites specified only as an IP,
# remove the # from the next line to leave only a '*ip':
#*ip

# Blanket SSL/CONNECT IP exception.  To allow all SSL and CONNECT
# tunnels to sites specified only as an IP,
# remove the # from the next line to leave only a '*ips':
#*ips
