The snortips daemon parses snort(8)'s alertfile (syslog) and blocks the naughty 
hosts for a specific amount of time using pfctl.  It also handles alertfile 
rotation.  By default it inserts hosts in the snortips table.  Snortips is able 
to recover previously blocked hosts when starting.  It will assign them the 
default block duration.  Snortips relies completely on pfctl output, and 
corrects its behavior and hosts tables accordingly.
