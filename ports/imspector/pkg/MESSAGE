You also need pf rules to redirect IM traffic to IMSpector.

To start imspector automatically, add these lines to /etc/rc.local

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/imspector ]; then
	mkdir /tmp/imspector
	chown -R _imspector:_imspector /tmp/imspector
	echo -n ' imspector';
	${PREFIX}/sbin/imspector -c ${SYSCONFDIR}/imspector/imspector.conf &
fi
