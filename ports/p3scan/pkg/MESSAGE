To run as a transparent proxy, you also need pf rules to redirect
POP3 traffic to p3scan, and /dev/pf must be readable by p3scan:

	chmod 644 /dev/pf

To start p3scan automatically, add these lines to ${SYSCONFDIR}/rc.local

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/p3scan ]; then
	echo -n ' p3scan';
	install -d -o _p3scan /var/run/p3scan
	${PREFIX}/sbin/p3scan -f ${SYSCONFDIR}/p3scan/p3scan.conf
fi
