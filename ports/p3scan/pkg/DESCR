This is a full-transparent proxy-server for email clients. It can
be used to provide email scanning from the internet, to any internal
network and is ideal for helping to protect your "Other OS" LAN
from harm, especially when used in conjunction with a firewall and
other Internet Proxy servers.

It is designed to enable scanning of incoming/outgoing email messages
for Virus's, Worms, Trojans, Spam (read as "Un-solicited Bulk
Email"), and harmfull attachments. Because viewing HTML mail can
enable a "Spammer" to validate an email address (via Web bugs), it
can also provide HTML stripping.
